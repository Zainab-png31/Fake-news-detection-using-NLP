# Fake-news-detection-using-NLP
The main objective is to build an intelligent model capable of identifying fake news based on textual patterns. The project begins with data collection, using open-source datasets such as the Kaggle Fake News Dataset, which contains labeled real and fake articles. These labeled samples provide a foundation for training the machine learning model.
